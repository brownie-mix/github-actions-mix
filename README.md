# github-actions-mix

This is a [Brownie](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie) project template preconfigured for:

* Continuous integration with [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions)
* Standardized testing environments with [tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox)
* Linting checks using [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) and [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort)
* [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for linting hooks

**Please read this entire document carefully to ensure the proper setup of each component.**

Feel free to join us in the Brownie [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/eth-brownie/community), or [open an issue](https://github.com/brownie-mix/github-actions-mix/issues) if you encounter a problem with this template.

## Installation

### Downloading the Template

1. [Install Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), if you haven't already.

2. Use the `bake` command to initialize a new project from this template:

    ```bash
    brownie bake github-actions
    ```

### Creating a Virtual Environment

It is **strongly recommended** use a virtual environment with this project. This ensures that dependencies are strictly contained within your project and will not alter or affect your other development environment.

To create a new virtual environment and install the required dependencie:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In future sessions, activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

To learn more about `venv`, see the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

### Configuring Pre-commit

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a tool that executes linting checks each time you make a commit. It is useful for enforcing proper codestyle and preventing commits that would fail the linting build.

To install pre-commit locally:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Once installed, the pre-commit hooks will automatically run each time you make a commit.

### Configuring Github Actions

[Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) is a hosted [continuous integration](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-and-testing-code-with-continuous-integration/about-continuous-integration) service provided by Github. It runs your project tests each time you push a new commit or open a pull request, providing quick feedback on the outcome of each change.

Github Actions is provided free for public repositories. It is automatically enabled - if you create your own project with this mix as a base it will be active whenever you push a commit.

Depending on the requirements of your project, you may need to set the following environment variables:

* `ETHERSCAN_TOKEN`: Etherscan [API token](https://etherscan.io/apis), required if you are querying source files from Etherscan.
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token), required by [py-solc-x](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x) when querying installable solc versions.
* `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: Infura [project ID](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nonlocal-networks.html#using-infura), required for connecting to Infura hosted nodes.

See the official [Github Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables) for information on how to set environment variables.

## Running the Tests

This project uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to standardize the local and remote testing environments.

To run all of your project's unit tests and perform linting checks:

```bash
tox
```

To run only the linting checks:

```bash
tox -e lint
```
